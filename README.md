# Iirs-machine-learning-practice
Repository containing showcase of machine learning knowledge acquired to the date of creation on Kaggle learn

## What have I learned so far?

Below there are listed Kaggle courses that I have completed, with chapters of each. Also, I put some of the most important concepts that I have learned in each course.

1. Intro to Machine Learning
- How to select data for model training
- Decision Trees
- Regression Trees
- Random Forests

2. Intermediate Machine Learning
- Missing values
- Categorical variables handling
- Pipelines
- Cross-validation
- XGBoost

3. Data Visualization
 
Tough I completed the course, it covered seaborn visualization tools, to which I prefer using matplotlib.

### notebook_2
- [ ] Impute missing values
- [ ] Handle categorical variables
- [ ] Create a model with Random Forests

### notebook_3
- [ ] Create a model with Pipelines
- [ ] Create a model with XGBoost
